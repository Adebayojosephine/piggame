The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.
But if a player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it is the next player's turn
The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it is the next players turn.
